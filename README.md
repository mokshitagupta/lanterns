`(Effect sped up by 4x for the gif)`

tried to reverse engineer this three js example (https://threejs.org/examples/?q=interactive#webgl_interactive_points) to understand the workings better and after adding a bloom pass, changing the geometry, modifying the colors through a sin function the effect looked a lot like diwali lights in a mela. added a quick and dirty latern model and simulation controls that play/pause/restart the lanterns flying away! :)
